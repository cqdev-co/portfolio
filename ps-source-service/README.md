# r/PennyStocks Scan Service

This will scan the r/pennystocks subreddit to look for pennystocks
that become signals. This will use intelligent filtering.

Something that I'm thinking about is that there are lots of posts that come in from 
this subreddit, so we will need to rank posts from most important / potential to least
important / worthless.

This will use Python, Reddit API, and Supabase. The .env is in the root of the repository.
