Proceed with removing 15 duplicate records? [y/N]: y

✅ Successfully removed 15 duplicate records

🎉 Cleanup completed successfully! Removed 15 duplicates.
```

### Environment Requirements

The script requires the same environment as the main scanner:

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment with scanner dependencies
- Supabase credentials in environment variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` or `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### How It Works

1. **Analysis Phase**: Scans the database for duplicate records (same symbol + scan_date)
2. **Backup Phase**: Creates a JSON backup of all records (if not dry-run)
3. **Cleanup Phase**: Removes older duplicate records, keeping the most recent
4. **Reporting Phase**: Shows detailed results of the cleanup operation

### Best Practices

1. **Always test first**: Use `--dry-run` to see what would be cleaned
2. **Regular maintenance**: Run weekly with `--days-back 7`
3. **Keep backups**: Don't delete backup files immediately
4. **Monitor logs**: Check for any errors during cleanup
5. **Verify results**: Run analysis again after cleanup to confirm

### Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues**:
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly
- Check network connectivity to Supabase
- Verify credentials have proper permissions

**No Duplicates Found**:
- This is normal if the upsert logic is working correctly
- The scanner should prevent duplicates automatically

**Backup Failures**:
- Check disk space for backup files
- Ensure write permissions in the script directory
- Large datasets may take time to backup

### Integration with Scanner

This script complements the scanner's built-in duplicate prevention:

- **Scanner**: Prevents duplicates during data insertion (upsert logic)
- **Cleanup Script**: Removes any duplicates that may have occurred due to race conditions or system issues

The combination ensures data integrity and optimal database performance.

## cleanup_meaningless_trades.py

A specialized script for cleaning meaningless trades (0.0% return) from the performance tracking system. This script is designed to keep the performance dashboard clean and meaningful by removing trades that provide no actionable insights.

### Features

- **Zero-Return Filtering**: Removes trades with exactly 0.0% return regardless of hold time
- **Dashboard Cleanup**: Keeps performance metrics clean and meaningful
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Designed to run automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dry Run Support**: Preview what would be cleaned without making changes
- **Safe Operations**: Detailed logging and error handling
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Shows before/after statistics

### Usage

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment first
cd volatility-squeeze-scanner
source ../venv/bin/activate

# Show help
python scripts/cleanup_meaningless_trades.py --help

# BASIC USAGE
# Preview cleanup (safe)
python scripts/cleanup_meaningless_trades.py --dry-run

# Actually clean meaningless trades
python scripts/cleanup_meaningless_trades.py

# POETRY USAGE (recommended)
# Preview cleanup
poetry run python scripts/cleanup_meaningless_trades.py --dry-run

# Run cleanup
poetry run python scripts/cleanup_meaningless_trades.py
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

This script is automatically integrated into the volatility squeeze scanner workflow (`vss.yml`) and runs after each market scan to keep the performance dashboard clean:

```yaml
- name: Cleanup Meaningless Trades
  env:
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL }}
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }}
  working-directory: volatility-squeeze-scanner
  run: |
    echo "🧹 Running performance tracking cleanup..."
    poetry run python scripts/cleanup_meaningless_trades.py
    echo "✅ Cleanup complete"
```

### What Gets Cleaned

The script removes performance tracking records where:
- **Return percentage is exactly 0.0%** (within 0.01% tolerance)
- **Any hold time** (0 days, 1 day, or longer)
- **Status is CLOSED** (doesn't affect active trades)

### Output Example

```
🧹 PERFORMANCE TRACKING CLEANUP
==================================================
Mode: LIVE CLEANUP

📊 ANALYSIS RESULTS:
  Total closed trades: 25
  Meaningful trades: 20
  Meaningless trades (0.0% return): 5

❌ MEANINGLESS TRADES TO REMOVE:
  • PC: $8.32 → $8.32 (+0.00%) in 0d [2025-09-24]
  • EGG: $6.26 → $6.26 (+0.00%) in 0d [2025-09-24]
  • ADCT: $3.52 → $3.52 (+0.00%) in 1d [2025-09-24]
  • SRI: $8.06 → $8.06 (+0.00%) in 0d [2025-09-24]
  • MSA: $169.97 → $169.97 (+0.00%) in 0d [2025-09-24]

🗑️  REMOVING MEANINGLESS TRADES...
    ✅ Deleted PC
    ✅ Deleted EGG
    ✅ Deleted ADCT
    ✅ Deleted SRI
    ✅ Deleted MSA

✅ CLEANUP COMPLETE:
  Successfully deleted: 5/5 trades
  Remaining meaningful trades: 20

📈 SAMPLE MEANINGFUL TRADES:
  • BBGI: +2.48% in 0d
  • ABVC: -1.24% in 0d
  • NMG: +2.44% in 0d
  • TE: +0.22% in 0d
  • CLCO: +0.54% in 0d

✅ CLEANUP COMPLETE: 5 meaningless trades removed
```

### Why This Matters

**Before Cleanup:**
- Performance dashboard cluttered with 0.0% trades
- Misleading win rates and average returns
- Difficult to identify meaningful patterns
- Poor user experience

**After Cleanup:**
- Clean, actionable performance data
- Accurate win rates and return metrics
- Clear identification of profitable strategies
- Professional presentation of results

### Integration with Performance Tracking

This script works in conjunction with the enhanced performance tracking service:

1. **Prevention**: Updated `PerformanceTrackingService` prevents most 0.0% trades from being created
2. **Cleanup**: This script removes any that slip through or were created before the prevention logic
3. **Automation**: GitHub Actions ensures cleanup happens after every scan
4. **Maintenance**: Can be run manually for historical cleanup

### Best Practices

1. **Run after major scans**: Especially useful after full market scans
2. **Monitor output**: Check logs to understand what's being cleaned
3. **Test first**: Use `--dry-run` when running manually
4. **Regular automation**: Let GitHub Actions handle routine cleanup
5. **Historical cleanup**: Run manually on historical data as needed

### Environment Requirements

Same as other scripts:
- Python 3.8+
- Poetry environment with scanner dependencies
- Supabase credentials in environment variables

This script ensures your **Live Performance Tracking** dashboard shows only meaningful, actionable trade data! 🎯
