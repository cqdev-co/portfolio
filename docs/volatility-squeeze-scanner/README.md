## Quick Start

### Daily Scan Results

The scanner runs automatically Monday-Friday at 6:30 AM UTC and provides:

1. **Signal Detection**: Identifies squeeze conditions across 12,167+ symbols
2. **Continuity Tracking**: Classifies signals as new, continuing, or ended
3. **Quality Scoring**: 0-1 score based on technical and volume factors
4. **Risk Management**: Stop loss levels and position sizing recommendations

### Interpreting Results

#### Signal Status Classification
- **🆕 NEW**: Just entered squeeze condition (fresh opportunity)
- **🔄 CONTINUING**: Been in squeeze for multiple days (established pattern)
- **🔚 ENDED**: No longer meets squeeze criteria (potential exit signal)

#### Quality Tiers
- **Exceptional (≥0.95)**: Highest confidence signals
- **Excellent (≥0.90)**: Strong actionable signals  
- **Very Good (≥0.80)**: Good quality signals
- **Good (≥0.70)**: Moderate quality signals
- **Fair (<0.70)**: Lower confidence signals
