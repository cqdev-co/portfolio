Never go all in play with money you can afford to lose

This reddit is like a recomendation you have to comb through stocks that are poping but after finding the right one do your own DD and research dont jump straight in

Sometimes take some time to see how the Stock performs in open hours before you jump in dont get stressed and FOMOed 4.dont be scared of losses it simply happens sometimes and take sometime before you invest again dont chase what you lost or you will lose more

Dont try to jump into something every day after a win or loss take some time maybe a week or two before starting hunting again 6.BIG FOMO help is realising that opportunities will come your way through your whole life dont try to jump in everytime take some time you are not missing out dont be greedy

Well thats all i have to say idk if it helps its just my perspective on how things go
