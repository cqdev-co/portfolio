## 🎯 Entry Strategies

- Enter on pullback, not at highs
- Best for volatile names

### Confirmation Entry (Swing)

- Wait for next day
- Enter only if breaks key level
- Reduces false signals

### Scale-In (Large Positions)

- 33% immediately
- 33% if profitable day 2-3
- 33% if hitting targets

---

## 💰 Exit Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### The 3-Step Exit:

```
50% profit → Sell 50% of position
100% profit → Sell 25% more (75% total out)
Trail remainder → 20% trailing stop
```

### Time-Based Exits:

```
14+ days → Let it run, trail stops
7-14 days → Tighten stops to 15%
<7 days → Close if not deep ITM
```

### Signal-Based Exits (Immediate):

- Opposite signals appear
- Major negative news
- Stop loss hit (-20% to -25%)
- Underlying breaks key support/resistance

## 📈 Correlation Multipliers

### When Multiple Signals Align:

| Confirmation Type    | Bonus Points | Example                  |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Same strike repeated | +3           | AAPL $270C seen 3x       |
| Adjacent strikes     | +2           | AMD $260C + $265C        |
| Time spreads         | +2           | Same strike, diff expiry |
| Sector confirmation  | +1           | AMD + TSM + NVDA         |
| Premium >$5M         | +2           | Institutional conviction |
| Multi-day signals    | +1/day       | Sustained interest       |

**8+ points = 5% position | 5-7 = 4% | 3-4 = 3% | 1-2 = 2% | 0 = Pass**
