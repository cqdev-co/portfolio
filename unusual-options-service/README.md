# Unusual Options Activity Scanner

Enterprise-grade unusual options activity detection system for identifying potential trading opportunities based on unusual institutional and informed trading patterns. This CLI-driven system monitors options flow, detects anomalies, and generates high-conviction signals that may indicate insider information or smart money positioning.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Capabilities
- **🕵️ Insider-Focused Detection**: Built to find suspicious plays that might indicate insider information
- **🚫 0DTE Noise Filter**: Automatically excludes 0-2 DTE gambling noise from TSLA/NVDA/META/AMZN
- **📊 Earnings Calendar Integration**: Shows earnings proximity and boosts pre-earnings positioning scores
- **Volume Anomaly Detection**: Identifies options contracts with unusual volume vs historical averages
- **Open Interest Analysis**: Tracks significant changes in open interest that may signal positioning
- **Premium Flow Tracking**: Monitors large premium expenditures and aggressive orders
- **Put/Call Ratio Analysis**: Detects unusual imbalances in put/call activity
- **Sweep Detection**: Identifies aggressive sweep orders across multiple exchanges
- **Time & Sales Analysis**: Real-time monitoring of large block trades
- **Historical Performance Tracking**: Backtests signals to measure predictive accuracy
- **Multi-timeframe Scoring**: Analyzes activity across intraday, daily, and weekly windows

### Technical Excellence
- **CLI-First Design**: Fast, scriptable command-line interface for automation
- **Supabase Integration**: Cloud-native storage for signals and historical performance
- **Async Architecture**: High-performance concurrent data processing
- **Rate Limit Management**: Intelligent request throttling for data providers
- **Signal Grading System**: S/A/B/C/D/F tier classification based on conviction
- **Risk Scoring**: Multi-factor risk assessment for each signal
- **Alert System**: Configurable notifications for high-conviction signals

## 📊 Signal Detection

### What Makes Options Activity "Unusual"?

1. **Volume Anomalies**
   - Current volume > 3x average daily volume
   - Volume surge in specific strikes near current price
   - Concentration in near-term expiries (< 30 DTE)

2. **Premium Flow**
   - Large single orders > $100k premium
   - Aggressive buying at ask (not limit orders)
   - Sustained buying pressure over multiple time windows

3. **Open Interest Changes**
   - Significant OI build in single strikes (> 20% daily increase)
   - OI accumulation in ITM or ATM strikes
   - Unusual OI in far-dated options (potential hedging or positioning)

4. **Directional Signals**
   - Heavy call buying → bullish signal
   - Heavy put buying → bearish signal
   - Collar/spread building → volatility expectations

5. **Smart Money Indicators**
   - Block trades executed during low liquidity periods
   - Sweep orders across multiple exchanges (urgency signal)
   - Institutional order patterns (size, timing, execution style)
