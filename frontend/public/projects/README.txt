# Project Images

Place your project images in this directory with the following filenames:

1. `security-platform.png` - Image for NextJS Security Platform project
2. `cloud-security.png` - Image for Cloud Security Automation project
3. `iac.png` - Image for Infrastructure as Code project

For best results, use images with a 16:9 aspect ratio (e.g., 1280x720 pixels) and consistent styling.

The portfolio will automatically display these images on your projects section.
